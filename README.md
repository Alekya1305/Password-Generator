# Password Generator

## Overview
The Password Generator is a Python-based application that creates strong and random passwords for users. It allows users to specify the desired length and complexity of the password to ensure security.

## Features
- User-defined password length
- Random password generation using a mix of characters (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special symbols)
- Simple and easy-to-use interface

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **random** module: Used for generating random characters
- **tkinter** (optional): Can be used to create a GUI version of the application

## How It Works
1. The user specifies the desired password length.
2. The application generates a random password using a combination of characters.
3. The generated password is displayed on the screen.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```

## Usage
- Run the script and input the required password length.
- The program will generate and display a strong, random password.
- Copy and use the generated password as needed.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding a graphical user interface using Tkinter.
- Allowing users to choose specific character types (e.g., numbers only, symbols only, etc.).
- Implementing password strength analysis.
